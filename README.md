## 📊 Chart Insights

### 1. **Genre vs. Average Playtime**

- **Indie games** have the highest average playtime, suggesting strong engagement and replayability despite often having smaller budgets.

- **Casual, Free to Play, and Early Access** titles show lower average playtime, which may reflect shorter gameplay loops or unfinished content.

- **Genre selection** is crucial for developers — choosing a genre with high engagement potential can influence player retention and monetization.


### 2. **Price Distribution by Genre**

- **Adventure games** consistently held the highest average price across the years.

- From **2014 to 2018**, most genres saw a noticeable dip in average price — possibly due to platform growth, increased competition, or the rise of frequent sales and bundles.

- **Indie games** have remained the most budget-friendly option, aligning with their smaller-scale production and frequent releases.

  

### 3. **Operating System Usage**

- The **majority of games** use the Windows operating system.

- **Mac and Linux** represent much smaller portions, suggesting limited support or demand for these platforms.

- Gamers on **non-Windows systems** may face fewer available titles or delayed updates.

## 📝 Project Summary

This was a personal exploration into Steam game trends, driven by my passion for gaming and data storytelling.  
All data transformation was done directly in **Tableau**, including calculated fields — with help from **Copilot** to separate genre fields, and to convert date strings into usable formats.

As a self-directed project, I had no set instructions, which gave me the freedom to experiment with chart types, layout, and visual style.  
It was a fun and insightful process that deepened my understanding of genre dynamics, pricing trends, and platform usage in the gaming world.
